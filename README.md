The raw network packets of the UNSW-NB 15 dataset are used in this project to gather information on different type of intrusions. It allows to train several models, that can distinguish intrusion from normal network traffic, that are compared. Also it produces information concerning the features in the dataset. It shows how to find strongly correlated features. It uses a LASSO-technique to find superfluous features.
